\begin{optionlist}



    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[breaksymbol (string) (breaksymbolleft)]
    Alias for \texttt{breaksymbolleft}.
    \switchcolumn
    \item[breaksymbol (string) (breaksymbolleft)]
    是\texttt{breaksymbolleft}的别名。
    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[breaksymbolleft (string) (\string\tiny\string\ensuremath\{\string\hookrightarrow\}, {\tiny\ensuremath{\hookrightarrow}})]
    The symbol used at the beginning (left) of continuation lines when \texttt{breaklines=true}.  To have no symbol, simply set \texttt{breaksymbolleft} to an empty string (``\texttt{=,}'' or ``\texttt{=\{\}}'').  The symbol is wrapped within curly braces \texttt{\{\}} when used, so there is no danger of formatting commands such as \texttt{\string\tiny} ``escaping.''
    \switchcolumn
    \item[breaksymbolleft (string) (\string\tiny\string\ensuremath\{\string\hookrightarrow\}, {\tiny\ensuremath{\hookrightarrow}})]
    在breaklines=true时，用于表示连续行开头的符号。要没有符号，只需将breaksymbolleft设置为空字符串（“=,”或“={}”）。当使用时，符号将被包裹在花括号{}中，因此不会出现格式命令（如\tiny）“逃逸”的危险。

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The \texttt{\string\hookrightarrow} and \texttt{\string\hookleftarrow} may be further customized by the use of the \texttt{\string\rotatebox} command provided by \pkg{graphicx}.  Additional arrow-type symbols that may be useful are available in the \pkg{dingbat} (\texttt{\string\carriagereturn}) and \pkg{mnsymbol} (hook and curve arrows) packages, among others.
    \switchcolumn
    \texttt{\string\hookrightarrow} 和 \texttt{\string\hookleftarrow}
可以通过\pkg{graphicx}提供的\texttt{\rotatebox}命令进行进一步自定义。其他可能有用的箭头类型符号可以在\pkg{dingbat}（\texttt{\carriagereturn}）和\pkg{mnsymbol}（hook和curve arrows）等包中找到。
    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Does not apply to \texttt{\string\mintinline}.
    \switchcolumn
    不适用于\texttt{\mintinline}。
    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[breaksymbolright (string) (\meta{none})]
    The symbol used at breaks (right) when \texttt{breaklines=true}. Does not appear at the end of the very last segment of a broken line.
    \switchcolumn
    \item[breaksymbolright (string) (\meta{none})]
    在breaklines=true时，用于表示断行（右边）的符号。不会出现在最后一行的最后一个片段的末尾。    
    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[breaksymbolindent (dimension) (\meta{breaksymbolindentleftnchars})]
Alias for |breaksymbolindentleft|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[breaksymbolindentnchars (integer) (\meta{breaksymbolindentleftnchars})]
Alias for |breaksymbolindentleftnchars|.

\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[breaksymbolindentleft (dimension) (\meta{breaksymbolindentleftnchars})]
The extra left indentation that is provided to make room for |breaksymbolleft|.  This indentation is only applied when there is a |breaksymbolleft|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Does not apply to \texttt{\string\mintinline}.
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[breaksymbolindentleftnchars (integer) (4)]
This allows |breaksymbolindentleft| to be specified as an integer number of characters rather than as a dimension (assumes a fixed-width font).
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[breaksymbolindentright (dimension) (\meta{breaksymbolindentrightnchars})]
The extra right indentation that is provided to make room for |breaksymbolright|.  This indentation is only applied when there is a |breaksymbolright|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[breaksymbolindentrightnchars (integer) (4)]
This allows |breaksymbolindentright| to be specified as an integer number of characters rather than as a dimension (assumes a fixed-width font).
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[breaksymbolsep (dimension) (\meta{breaksymbolsepleftnchars})]
Alias for |breaksymbolsepleft|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[breaksymbolsepnchars (integer) (\meta{breaksymbolsepleftnchars})]
Alias for |breaksymbolsepleftnchars|.

\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[breaksymbolsepleft (dimension) (\meta{breaksymbolsepleftnchars})]
The separation between the |breaksymbolleft| and the adjacent text. 
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[breaksymbolsepleftnchars (integer) (2)]
Allows |breaksymbolsepleft| to be specified as an integer number of characters rather than as a dimension (assumes a fixed-width font).

\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[breaksymbolsepright (dimension) (\meta{breaksymbolseprightnchars})]
The \emph{minimum} separation between the |breaksymbolright| and the adjacent text.  This is the separation between |breaksymbolright| and the furthest extent to which adjacent text could reach.  In practice, |\linewidth| will typically not be an exact integer multiple of the character width (assuming a fixed-width font), so the actual separation between the |breaksymbolright| and adjacent text will generally be larger than |breaksymbolsepright|.  This ensures that break symbols have the same spacing from the margins on both left and right.  If the same spacing from text is desired instead, |breaksymbolsepright| may be adjusted.  (See the definition of |\FV@makeLineNumber| in \pkg{fvextra} for implementation details.)
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[breaksymbolseprightnchars (integer) (2)]
Allows |breaksymbolsepright| to be specified as an integer number of characters rather than as a dimension (assumes a fixed-width font).
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item[bgcolor (string) (\meta{none})]
    Background color of the listing.  Be aware that this option has several limitations (described below); see ``Framing alternatives'' below for more powerful alternatives.
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The value of this option must \emph{not} be a color command. Instead, it must be a color \emph{name}, given as a string, of a previously-defined color:
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{example}
    \definecolor{bg}{rgb}{0.95,0.95,0.95}
    \begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{php}
    <?php
        echo "Hello, $x";
    ?>
    \end{minted}
\end{example}
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
This option puts \texttt{minted} environments and \texttt{\string\mint} commands in a \texttt{snugshade*} environment from the \pkg{framed} package, which supports breaks across pages.  (Prior to \pkg{minted} 2.2, a \texttt{minipage} was used, which prevented page breaks and gave undesirable spacing from surrounding text.)  Be aware that if \texttt{bgcolor} is used with \texttt{breaklines=true}, and a line break occurs just before a page break, then text may extend below the colored background in some instances.  It is best to use a more advanced framing package in those cases; see ``Framing alternatives'' below.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
This option puts \texttt{\string\mintinline} inside a \texttt{\string\colorbox}, which \textbf{does not allow line breaks}.  If you want to use \texttt{\string\setminted} to set background colors, and only want background colors on \texttt{minted} and \texttt{\string\mint}, you may use \texttt{\string\setmintedinline\{bgcolor=\{\}\}} to turn off the coloring for inline commands.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
~

\textbf{Framing alternatives}
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
If you want more reliable and advanced options for background colors and framing, you should consider a more advanced framing package such as \pkg{mdframed} or \pkg{tcolorbox}.  It is easy to add framing to \pkg{minted} commands and environments using the \pkg{etoolbox} package, which is automatically loaded by \pkg{minted}.  For example, using \pkg{mdframed}:
\begin{Verbatim}
\BeforeBeginEnvironment{minted}{\begin{mdframed}}
\AfterEndEnvironment{minted}{\end{mdframed}}
\end{Verbatim}
Some framing packages also provide built-in commands for such purposes.  For example, \pkg{mdframed} provides a \texttt{\string\surroundwithmdframed} command, which could be used to add a frame to all \texttt{minted} environments:
\begin{Verbatim}
\surroundwithmdframed{minted}
\end{Verbatim}
\pkg{tcolorbox} even provides a built-in framing environment with \pkg{minted} support.  Simply use \texttt{\string\tcbuselibrary\{minted\}} in the preamble, and then put code within a \texttt{tcblisting} environment:
\begin{Verbatim}
\begin{tcblisting}{<tcb options>,
                  minted language=<language>,
                  minted style=<style>,
                  minted options={<option list>} }
<code>
\end{tcblisting}
\end{Verbatim}
\pkg{tcolorbox} provides other commands and environments for fine-tuning listing appearance and for working with external code files.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[codetagify (list of strings) (\textrm{highlight \texttt{XXX}, \texttt{TODO}, \texttt{BUG}, and \texttt{NOTE}})]
    Highlight special code tags in comments and docstrings.
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[curlyquotes (boolean) (false)]
By default, the backtick \texttt{\textasciigrave} and typewriter single quotation mark \texttt{\textquotesingle} always appear literally, instead of becoming the left and right curly single quotation marks \texttt{`'}.  This option allows these characters to be replaced by the curly quotation marks when that is desirable.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[encoding (string) (\meta{system-specific})]
    Sets the file encoding that \app{Pygments} expects.  See also |outencoding|.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[escapeinside (string) (\meta{none})]
  Escape to \LaTeX\ between the two characters specified in \texttt{\string(string\string)}.  All code between the two characters will be interpreted as \LaTeX\ and typeset accordingly.  This allows for additional formatting.  The escape characters need not be identical.  Special \LaTeX\ characters must be escaped when they are used as the escape characters (for example, \texttt{escapeinside=\textbackslash\#\textbackslash\%}).  Requires \app{Pygments} 2.0+.
  \switchcolumn

  \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Escaping does not work inside strings and comments (for comments, there is \texttt{texcomments}).  As of Pygments 2.0.2, this means that escaping is ``fragile'' with some lexers.}  Due to the way that Pygments implements \texttt{escapeinside}, any ``escaped'' \LaTeX\ code that resembles a string or comment for the current lexer may break \texttt{escapeinside}.  There is a \href{https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/issue/1118}{Pygments issue} for this case.  Additional details and a limited workaround for some scenarios are available on the \href{https://github.com/gpoore/minted/issues/70#issuecomment-111729930}{\pkg{minted} GitHub site}.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begingroup  ^^A Need to prevent active "|" from causing problems
\catcode`\|=11
\begin{example}
    \begin{minted}[escapeinside=||]{py}
    def f(x):
        y = x|\colorbox{green}{**}|2
        return y
    \end{minted}
\end{example}
\endgroup

\textbf{Note that when math is used inside escapes, any active characters beyond those that are normally active in verbatim can cause problems.}  Any package that relies on special active characters in math mode (for example, \pkg{icomma}) will produce errors along the lines of \texttt{TeX capacity exceeded} and \texttt{\string\leavevmode \string\kern \string\z@}.  This may be fixed by modifying \texttt{\string\@noligs}, as described at \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/223876}.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[firstline (integer) (1)]
    The first line to be shown.
    All lines before that line are ignored and do not appear in the output.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[firstnumber (auto \| last \| integer) (auto = 1)]
    Line number of the first line.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[fontfamily (family name) (tt)]
    The font family to use.
    |tt|, |courier| and |helvetica| are pre-defined.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[fontseries (series name) (auto \textrm{-- the same as the current font})]
    The font series to use.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[fontsize (font size) (auto \textrm{-- the same as the current font})]
    The size of the font to use, as a size command, e.g. |\footnotesize|.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[fontshape (font shape) (auto \textrm{-- the same as the current font})]
    The font shape to use.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[formatcom (command) (\meta{none})]
    A format to execute before printing verbatim text.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[frame (none \| leftline \| topline \| bottomline \| lines \| single) (none)]
    The type of frame to put around the source code listing.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[framerule (dimension) (0.4pt)]
    Width of the frame.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[framesep (dimension) (\cmd\fboxsep)]
    Distance between frame and content.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[funcnamehighlighting (boolean) (true)] \appliesto{PHP}
    If |true|, highlights built-in function names.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[gobble (integer) (0)]
    Remove the first $n$ characters from each input line.
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[highlightcolor (string) (LightCyan)]
Set the color used for |highlightlines|, using a predefined color name from \pkg{color} or \pkg{xcolor}, or a color defined via |\definecolor|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[highlightlines (string) (\meta{none})]
This highlights a single line or a range of lines based on line numbers.  For example, |highlightlines={1, 3-4}|.  The line numbers refer to the line numbers that would appear if |linenos=true|, etc.  They do not refer to original or actual line numbers before adjustment by |firstnumber|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
The highlighting color can be customized with |highlightcolor|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item[keywordcase] (string) (lower)
    Changes capitalization of keywords.  Takes |lower|, |upper|, or |capitalize|.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[label (string) (\emph{empty})]
    Add a label to the top, the bottom or both of the frames around the code.
    See the \pkg{fancyvrb} documentation for more information and examples.
    \emph{Note:} This does \emph{not} add a |\label| to the current listing.
    To achieve that, use a floating environment (section \ref{sec:float}) instead.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[labelposition (none \| topline \| bottomline \| all) (topline, all,  \textrm{or} none)]
    Position where to print the label (see above;  default: |topline| if one label is defined, |all| if two are defined, |none| else).
    See the \pkg{fancyvrb} documentation for more information.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[lastline (integer) (\meta{last line of input})]
    The last line to be shown.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[linenos (boolean) (false)]
    Enables line numbers.
    In order to customize the display style of line numbers, you need to redefine the |\theFancyVerbLine| macro:
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{example}
    \renewcommand{\theFancyVerbLine}{\sffamily
        \textcolor[rgb]{0.5,0.5,1.0}{\scriptsize
        \oldstylenums{\arabic{FancyVerbLine}}}}

    \begin{minted}[linenos,
        firstnumber=11]{python}
    def all(iterable):
        for i in iterable:
            if not i: 
                return False
        return True
    \end{minted}
\end{example}

\item[numberfirstline (boolean) (false)]
Always number the first line, regardless of |stepnumber|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item[numbers (left \| right \| both \| none) (none)]
    Essentially the same as |linenos|, except the side on which the numbers appear may be specified.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[mathescape (boolean) (false)]
    Enable \LaTeX{} math mode inside comments.
    Usage as in package \pkg{listings}.
    See the note under \texttt{escapeinside} regarding math and ligatures.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[numberblanklines (boolean) (true)]
    Enables or disables numbering of blank lines.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[numbersep (dimension) (12pt)]
    Gap between numbers and start of line.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[obeytabs (boolean) (false)]
    Treat tabs as tabs instead of converting them to spaces---that is, expand them to tab stops determined by |tabsize|.  \textcolor{DarkRed}{\textbf{While this will correctly expand tabs within leading indentation, usually it will not correctly expand tabs that are preceded by anything other than spaces or other tabs.  It should be avoided in those case.}}
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[outencoding (string) (\meta{system-specific})]
    Sets the file encoding that \app{Pygments} uses for highlighted output.  Overrides any encoding previously set via |encoding|.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[python3 (boolean) (false)] \appliesto{PythonConsoleLexer}
    Specifies whether Python 3 highlighting is applied.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[resetmargins (boolean) (false)]
    Resets the left margin inside other environments.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[rulecolor (color command) (black)]
    The color of the frame.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[samepage (boolean) (false)]
    Forces the whole listing to appear on the same page, even if it doesn't fit.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[showspaces (boolean) (false)]
    Enables visible spaces: \verb*/visible spaces/.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[showtabs (boolean) (false)]
    Enables visible tabs---only works in combination with |obeytabs|.
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[space (macro) (\string\textvisiblespace, \textvisiblespace)]
Redefine the visible space character.  Note that this is only used if |showspaces=true|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[spacecolor (string) (none)]
Set the color of visible spaces.  By default (|none|), they take the color of their surroundings.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item[startinline (boolean) (false)] \appliesto{PHP}
    Specifies that the code starts in PHP mode, i.e., leading |<?php| is omitted.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[style] (string) (\meta{default})
    Sets the stylesheet used by \app{Pygments}.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[stepnumber (integer) (1)]
    Interval at which line numbers appear.
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[stepnumberfromfirst (boolean) (false)]
By default, when line numbering is used with |stepnumber| $\ne 1$, only line numbers that are a multiple of |stepnumber| are included.  This offsets the line numbering from the first line, so that the first line, and all lines separated from it by a multiple of |stepnumber|, are numbered.

\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[stepnumberoffsetvalues (boolean) (false)]
By default, when line numbering is used with |stepnumber| $\ne 1$, only line numbers that are a multiple of |stepnumber| are included.  Using |firstnumber| to offset the numbering will change which lines are numbered and which line gets which number, but will not change which \emph{numbers} appear.  This option causes |firstnumber| to be ignored in determining which line numbers are a multiple of |stepnumber|.  |firstnumber| is still used in calculating the actual numbers that appear.  As a result, the line numbers that appear will be a multiple of |stepnumber|, plus |firstnumber| minus 1.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item[stripall (boolean) (false)]
    Strip all leading and trailing whitespace from the input.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[stripnl (boolean) (false)]
    Strip leading and trailing newlines from the input.

    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[tab (macro) ({\rmfamily\pkg{fancyvrb}'s} \string\FancyVerbTab, \FancyVerbTab)]
Redefine the visible tab character.  Note that this is only used if |showtabs=true|.  |\rightarrowfill|, \hbox to 2em{\rightarrowfill}, may be a nice alternative.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[tabcolor (string) (black)]
Set the color of visible tabs.  If |tabcolor=none|, tabs take the color of their surroundings.  This is typically undesirable for tabs that indent multiline comments or strings.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item[tabsize (integer) (8)]
    The number of spaces a tab is equivalent to.  If |obeytabs| is \emph{not} active, tabs will be converted into this number of spaces.  If |obeytabs| is active, tab stops will be set this number of space characters apart.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[texcl (boolean) (false)]
    Enables \LaTeX{} code inside comments.
    Usage as in package \pkg{listings}.  See the note under \texttt{escapeinside} regarding math and ligatures.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[texcomments (boolean) (false)]
    Enables \LaTeX{} code inside comments.  The newer name for |texcl|.  See the note under |escapeinside| regarding math and ligatures.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

    As of Pygments 2.0.2, \texttt{texcomments} fails with multiline C/C++ preprocessor directives, and may fail in some other circumstances.  This is because preprocessor directives are \href{http://pygments.org/docs/tokens/}{tokenized as \texttt{Comment.Preproc}}, so \texttt{texcomments} causes preprocessor directives to be treated as literal \LaTeX\ code.  \href{https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/issue/1086/wrong-processing-of-in-c-c-macros-if-is}{An issue has been opened} at the Pygments site; additional details are also available on the \href{https://github.com/gpoore/minted/issues/66}{\pkg{minted} GitHub site}.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[xleftmargin (dimension) (0)]
    Indentation to add before the listing.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[xrightmargin (dimension) (0)]
    Indentation to add after the listing.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
