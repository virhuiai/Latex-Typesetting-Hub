  \item[escapeinside (string) (\meta{none})]
  Escape to \LaTeX\ between the two characters specified in \texttt{\string(string\string)}.  All code between the two characters will be interpreted as \LaTeX\ and typeset accordingly.  This allows for additional formatting.  The escape characters need not be identical.  Special \LaTeX\ characters must be escaped when they are used as the escape characters (for example, \texttt{escapeinside=\textbackslash\#\textbackslash\%}).  Requires \app{Pygments} 2.0+.
  \switchcolumn

  \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Escaping does not work inside strings and comments (for comments, there is \texttt{texcomments}).  As of Pygments 2.0.2, this means that escaping is ``fragile'' with some lexers.}  Due to the way that Pygments implements \texttt{escapeinside}, any ``escaped'' \LaTeX\ code that resembles a string or comment for the current lexer may break \texttt{escapeinside}.  There is a \href{https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/issue/1118}{Pygments issue} for this case.  Additional details and a limited workaround for some scenarios are available on the \href{https://github.com/gpoore/minted/issues/70#issuecomment-111729930}{\pkg{minted} GitHub site}.

\begingroup  ^^A Need to prevent active "|" from causing problems
\catcode`\|=11
\begin{example}
    \begin{minted}[escapeinside=||]{py}
    def f(x):
        y = x|\colorbox{green}{**}|2
        return y
    \end{minted}
\end{example}
\endgroup

\textbf{Note that when math is used inside escapes, any active characters beyond those that are normally active in verbatim can cause problems.}  Any package that relies on special active characters in math mode (for example, \pkg{icomma}) will produce errors along the lines of \texttt{TeX capacity exceeded} and \texttt{\string\leavevmode \string\kern \string\z@}.  This may be fixed by modifying \texttt{\string\@noligs}, as described at \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/223876}.
\switchcolumn

Set the color used for |highlightlines|, using a predefined color name from \pkg{color} or \pkg{xcolor}, or a color defined via |\definecolor|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[highlightlines (string) (\meta{none})]
This highlights a single line or a range of lines based on line numbers.  For example, |highlightlines={1, 3-4}|.  The line numbers refer to the line numbers that would appear if |linenos=true|, etc.  They do not refer to original or actual line numbers before adjustment by |firstnumber|.

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[lastline (integer) (\meta{last line of input})]
    The last line to be shown.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[linenos (boolean) (false)]
    Enables line numbers.
    In order to customize the display style of line numbers, you need to redefine the |\theFancyVerbLine| macro:
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{example}
    \renewcommand{\theFancyVerbLine}{\sffamily
        \textcolor[rgb]{0.5,0.5,1.0}{\scriptsize
        \oldstylenums{\arabic{FancyVerbLine}}}}

    \begin{minted}[linenos,
        firstnumber=11]{python}
    def all(iterable):
        for i in iterable:
            if not i:

        return True
    \end{minted}
\end{example}

    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[mathescape (boolean) (false)]

    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[numberblanklines (boolean) (true)]
    Enables or disables numbering of blank lines.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[numbersep (dimension) (12pt)]
    Gap between numbers and start of line.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[obeytabs (boolean) (false)]
    Treat tabs as tabs instead of converting them to spaces---that is, expand them to tab stops determined by |tabsize|.  \textcolor{DarkRed}{\textbf{While this will correctly expand tabs within leading indentation, usually it will not correctly expand tabs that are preceded by anything other than spaces or other tabs.  It should be avoided in those case.}}
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[outencoding (string) (\meta{system-specific})]
    Sets the file encoding that \app{Pygments} uses for highlighted output.  Overrides any encoding previously set via |encoding|.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[python3 (boolean) (false)] \appliesto{PythonConsoleLexer}
    Specifies whether Python 3 highlighting is applied.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[resetmargins (boolean) (false)]

  \item[samepage (boolean) (false)]
    Forces the whole listing to appear on the same page, even if it doesn't fit.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[showspaces (boolean) (false)]
    Enables visible spaces: \verb*/visible spaces/.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[showtabs (boolean) (false)]
    Enables visible tabs---only works in combination with |obeytabs|.
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[space (macro) (\string\textvisiblespace, \textvisiblespace)]
Redefine the visible space character.  Note that this is only used if |showspaces=true|.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[spacecolor (string) (none)]
Set the color of visible spaces.  By default (|none|), they take the color of their surroundings.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item[startinline (boolean) (false)] \appliesto{PHP}
    Specifies that the code starts in PHP mode, i.e., leading |<?php| is omitted.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[style] (string) (\meta{default})
    Sets the stylesheet used by \app{Pygments}.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[stepnumber (integer) (1)]
    Interval at which line numbers appear.
    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[stepnumberfromfirst (boolean) (false)]
By default, when line numbering is used with |stepnumber| $\ne 1$, only line numbers that are a multiple of |stepnumber| are included.  This offsets the line numbering from the first line, so that the first line, and all lines separated from it by a multiple of |stepnumber|, are numbered.

\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[stepnumberoffsetvalues (boolean) (false)]
By default, when line numbering is used with |stepnumber| $\ne 1$, only line numbers that are a multiple of |stepnumber| are included.  Using |firstnumber| to offset the numbering will change which lines are numbered and which line gets which number, but will not change which \emph{numbers} appear.  This option causes |firstnumber| to be ignored in determining which line numbers are a multiple of |stepnumber|.  |firstnumber| is still used in calculating the actual numbers that appear.  As a result, the line numbers that appear will be a multiple of |stepnumber|, plus |firstnumber| minus 1.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item[stripall (boolean) (false)]
    Strip all leading and trailing whitespace from the input.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[stripnl (boolean) (false)]
    Strip leading and trailing newlines from the input.

    \switchcolumn

    \switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[tab (macro) ({\rmfamily\pkg{fancyvrb}'s} \string\FancyVerbTab, \FancyVerbTab)]
Redefine the visible tab character.  Note that this is only used if |showtabs=true|.  |\rightarrowfill|, \hbox to 2em{\rightarrowfill}, may be a nice alternative.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item[tabcolor (string) (black)]
Set the color of visible tabs.  If |tabcolor=none|, tabs take the color of their surroundings.  This is typically undesirable for tabs that indent multiline comments or strings.
\switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item[tabsize (integer) (8)]
    The number of spaces a tab is equivalent to.  If |obeytabs| is \emph{not} active, tabs will be converted into this number of spaces.  If |obeytabs| is active, tab stops will be set this number of space characters apart.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[texcl (boolean) (false)]
    Enables \LaTeX{} code inside comments.
    Usage as in package \pkg{listings}.  See the note under \texttt{escapeinside} regarding math and ligatures.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[texcomments (boolean) (false)]
    Enables \LaTeX{} code inside comments.  The newer name for |texcl|.  See the note under |escapeinside| regarding math and ligatures.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%

    As of Pygments 2.0.2, \texttt{texcomments} fails with multiline C/C++ preprocessor directives, and may fail in some other circumstances.  This is because preprocessor directives are \href{http://pygments.org/docs/tokens/}{tokenized as \texttt{Comment.Preproc}}, so \texttt{texcomments} causes preprocessor directives to be treated as literal \LaTeX\ code.  \href{https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/issue/1086/wrong-processing-of-in-c-c-macros-if-is}{An issue has been opened} at the Pygments site; additional details are also available on the \href{https://github.com/gpoore/minted/issues/66}{\pkg{minted} GitHub site}.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[xleftmargin (dimension) (0)]
    Indentation to add before the listing.
    \switchcolumn

\switchcolumn[0]*%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item[xrightmargin (dimension) (0)]
    Indentation to add after the listing.
