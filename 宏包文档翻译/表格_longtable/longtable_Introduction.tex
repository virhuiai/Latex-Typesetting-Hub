The \package{longtable} package defines a new environment,
\DescribeEnv{longtable}
\env{longtable}, which has most of the features of the \env{tabular}
environment, but produces tables which may be broken by \TeX's
standard page-breaking algorithm. It also shares some features with
the \env{table} environment. In particular it uses the same counter,
\texttt{table}, and has a similar "\caption" command. Also, the
standard "\listoftables" command lists tables produced by either the
\env{table} or \env{longtable} environments.
\switchcolumn
\package{longtable} 宏包定义了一个新的环境 \env{longtable}，它大多数特性与 \env{tabular} 环境相同，但是能够根据 \TeX 的标准分页算法将表格分页显示。同时，它也与 \env{table} 环境共享一些特性。特别是它使用相同的计数器 \texttt{table} 和类似的 "\caption" 命令。另外，"\listoftables" 命令能够列出由 \env{table} 或 \env{longtable} 环境生成的表格。

The following example uses most of the features of the \env{longtable}
environment. An edited listing of the input for this example appears
in Section~\ref{listing}.
\switchcolumn 下面的示例使用了\env{longtable}环境的大多数功能。本示例的输入编辑列表在第~\ref{listing}节中。

\textbf{Note:} Various parts of the following table will
\textbf{not} line up correctly until this document has been run
through \LaTeX\ several times.  This is a characteristic feature of
this package, as described below.
\switchcolumn 注意：在此表中，各部分的对齐可能需要多次运行该文档才能正确实现。这是该软件包的特征之一，如下所述。

Some lines may take up a lot of space, like this: &
    \raggedleft This last column is a ``p'' column so this
    ``row'' of the table can take up several lines. Note however that
    \TeX\ will  never break a page within such a row. Page breaks only
    occur between rows of the table or at "\hline" commands.
