\tikzname\ is not the only graphics package for \TeX. In the following, I try
to give a reasonably fair comparison of \tikzname\ and other packages.
%

\tikzname 并不是 \TeX 的唯一绘图包。接下来，我将尽量公正地比较 \tikzname 和其他包的特点。

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The standard \LaTeX\ |{picture}| environment allows you to create
        simple graphics, but little more. This is certainly not due to a lack
        of knowledge or imagination on the part of \LaTeX's designer(s).
        Rather, this is the price paid for the |{picture}| environment's
        portability: It works together with all backend drivers.

        标准的 \LaTeX\ |{picture}| 环境允许你创建简单的图形，但是不太可能做更多。这肯定不是因为 \LaTeX 的设计者缺乏知识或想象力。反而，这是为了 |{picture}| 环境的可移植性而付出的代价：它可以与所有后端驱动一起工作。
    \item The |pstricks| package is certainly powerful enough to create any
        conceivable kind of graphic, but it is not really portable. Most
        importantly, it does not work with |pdftex| nor with any other driver
        that produces anything but PostScript code.

        |pstricks| 包肯定足够强大，能够创建任何可想象的图形，但它实际上并不真正可移植。最重要的是，它不与 |pdftex| 或任何其他产生除 PostScript 代码之外的东西的驱动一起工作。

        Compared to \tikzname, |pstricks| has a similar support base. There
        are many nice extra packages for special purpose situations that have
        been contributed by users over the last decade. The \tikzname\ syntax
        is more consistent than the |pstricks| syntax as \tikzname\ was
        developed ``in a more centralized manner'' and also ``with the
        shortcomings on |pstricks| in mind''.

        与 \tikzname 相比，|pstricks| 有着相似的支持基础。过去十年里，用户贡献了许多用于特殊目的情况的漂亮的额外包。与 |pstricks| 语法相比，\tikzname\ 的语法更加一致，因为 \tikzname\ 是“以更集中的方式”开发的，也是“考虑到 |pstricks| 的不足”开发的。
    \item The |xypic| package is an older package for creating graphics.
        However, it is more difficult to use and to learn because the syntax
        and the documentation are a bit cryptic.

        |xypic| 包是一个用于创建图形的旧包。然而，由于语法和文档都有些晦涩，所以使用它并学习它更加困难。
    \item The |dratex| package is a small graphic package for creating a
        graphics. Compared to the other package, including \tikzname, it is
        very small, which may or may not be an advantage.

        |dratex| 包是一个用于创建图形的小型图形包。与包括 \tikzname 在内的其他包相比，它非常小，这可能是优点也可能是缺点。
    \item The |metapost| program is a powerful alternative to \tikzname. It
        used to be an external program, which entailed a bunch of problems,
        but in Lua\TeX\ it is now built in. An obstacle with |metapost| is
        the inclusion of labels. This is \emph{much} easier to achieve using
        \pgfname.

        |metapost| 程序是 \tikzname 的一个强大的替代品。它过去是一个外部程序，这带来了一堆问题，但在 Lua\TeX 中，它现在是内置的。使用 |metapost| 的一个障碍是标签的包含。使用 \pgfname 这个任务就\emph{容易得多}。
    \item The |xfig| program is an important alternative to \tikzname\ for
        users who do not wish to ``program'' their graphics as is necessary
        with \tikzname\ and the other packages above. There is a conversion
        program that will convert |xfig| graphics to \tikzname.

        |xfig| 程序是对那些不希望像 \tikzname 和上述其他包那样“编程”其图形的用户来说，是 \tikzname 的一个重要替代品。有一个转换程序可以将 |xfig| 图形转换为 \tikzname。
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Utility Packages}

The \pgfname\ package comes along with a number of utility package that are not
really about creating graphics and which can be used independently of \pgfname.
However, they are bundled with \pgfname, partly out of convenience, partly
because their functionality is closely intertwined with \pgfname. These utility
packages are:
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The |pgfkeys| package defines a powerful key management facility.
        It can be used completely independently of \pgfname.
    \item The |pgffor| package defines a useful |\foreach| statement.
    \item The |pgfcalendar| package defines macros for creating calendars.
        Typically, these calendars will be rendered using \pgfname's graphic
        engine, but you can use |pgfcalendar| also typeset calendars using
        normal text. The package also defines commands for ``working'' with
        dates.
    \item The |pgfpages| package is used to assemble several pages into a
        single page. It provides commands for assembling several ``virtual
        pages'' into a single ``physical page''. The idea is that whenever
        \TeX\ has a page ready for ``shipout'', |pgfpages| interrupts this
        shipout and instead stores the page to be shipped out in a special
        box. When enough ``virtual pages'' have been accumulated in this way,
        they are scaled down and arranged on a ``physical page'', which then
        \emph{really} shipped out. This mechanism allows you to create ``two
        page on one page'' versions of a document directly inside \LaTeX\
        without the use of any external programs. However, |pgfpages| can do
        quite a lot more than that. You can use it to put logos and watermark
        on pages, print up to 16 pages on one page, add borders to pages, and
        more.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{How to Read This Manual}

This manual describes both the design of \tikzname\ and its usage. The
organization is very roughly according to ``user-friendliness''. The commands
and subpackages that are easiest and most frequently used are described first,
more low-level and esoteric features are discussed later.

If you have not yet installed \tikzname, please read the installation first.
Second, it might be a good idea to read the tutorial. Finally, you might wish
to skim through the description of \tikzname. Typically, you will not need to
read the sections on the basic layer. You will only need to read the part on
the system layer if you intend to write your own frontend or if you wish to
port \pgfname\ to a new driver.

The ``public'' commands and environments provided by the system are described
throughout the text. In each such description, the described command,
environment or option is printed in red. Text shown in green is optional and
can be left out.


\subsection{Authors and Acknowledgements}
\label{section-authors}

The bulk of the \pgfname\ system and its documentation was written by Till
Tantau. A further member of the main team is Mark Wibrow, who is responsible,
for example, for the \pgfname\ mathematical engine, many shapes, the decoration
engine, and matrices. The third member is Christian Feuers\"anger who
contributed the floating point library, image externalization, extended key
processing, and automatic hyperlinks in the manual.

Furthermore, occasional contributions have been made by Christophe Jorssen,
Jin-Hwan Cho, Olivier Binda, Matthias Schulz, Ren\'ee Ahrens, Stephan Schuster,
and Thomas Neumann.

Additionally, numerous people have contributed to the \pgfname\ system by
writing emails, spotting bugs, or sending libraries and patches. Many thanks to
all these people, who are too numerous to name them all!


\subsection{Getting Help}

When you need help with \pgfname\ and \tikzname, please do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read the manual, at least the part that has to do with your
        problem.
    \item If that does not solve the problem, try having a look at the
        GitHub development page for \pgfname\ and \tikzname\ (see the
        title of this document). Perhaps someone has already reported a
        similar problem and someone has found a solution.
    \item On the website you will find numerous forums for getting help.
        There, you can write to help forums, file bug reports, join mailing
        lists, and so on.
    \item Before you file a bug report, especially a bug report concerning
        the installation, make sure that this is really a bug. In particular,
        have a look at the |.log| file that results when you \TeX\ your
        files. This |.log| file should show that all the right files are
        loaded from the right directories. Nearly all installation problems
        can be resolved by looking at the |.log| file.
    \item \emph{As a last resort} you can try to email me (Till Tantau) or,
        if the problem concerns the mathematical engine, Mark Wibrow. I do
        not mind getting emails, I simply get way too many of them. Because
        of this, I cannot guarantee that your emails will be answered in a 
        timely fashion or even at all. Your chances that your problem will
        be fixed are somewhat higher if you mail to the \pgfname\ mailing
        list (naturally, I read this list and answer questions when I have
        the time).
\end{enumerate}
