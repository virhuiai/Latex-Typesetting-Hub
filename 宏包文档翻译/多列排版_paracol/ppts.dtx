% the corresponding space in the pages\footnote{

% You might complain the immaturity of \parapag{}ing and might claim that it
% should be included in \Paracol{} after the author implements the
% mechanism.  In fact the author himself is frustrated current features of
% \parapag{}ing but he dared to release the version 1.3 knowing that there

% current limited features.}.
% 
% In addition, you might think it is weird that the |c| feature of
% \!\twosided! swaps columns \emph{and} paired pages.  However this swapping
% is a natural consequence of the combination of \cswap{} and \paired{}

% together with other features) to have more intuitive results.
% 
% In the next Section~\ref{sec:ppts-npaired}, you will see another kind of
% \parapag{}ing namely \npaired{} one.  Before that, we need a blank page to
% let the \npaired{} \parapag{}ing start from an even-numbered page so that
% a left and right page pair comprises a double spread.  A short remark on
% the blank next page is that it does not have a right counterpart
% \parapag{}e because the page is outside \env{paracol} environments and does
% not have any portion from the environments\footnote{
