% \label{sec:bgpaint-me}
% \twosided
% 
% At a glance, this and the next three pages look painted similarly to
% previous four pages, but by a careful examination you should notice
% two important differences.  The first one is found in the colors
% of left and right margins.  As the author enabled all features of
% \Uidx{\!\twosided!} including |b| for \mirror{}ing and we are now in an
% even-numbered page \pageref{sec:bgpaint-me}, the left and outside margin
% is painted by dark green for the region |r|(ight margin), while the right
% and inside one is painted by dark blue for |l|(eft margin).
% 
% The other is that regions are enlarged, shrunk or shifted by 4\,|pt| by
% the following \!\backgroundcolor! commands with extensions.
% 
% \begin{itemize}\item[]
% |\backgroundcolor{t(0pt,0pt)(0pt,-4pt)}[rgb]{0.7,0,0}   |
%     |% B up|\\

% 
% \SpecialUsageIndex{\backgroundcolor}
% 
% In the comments above, |L|(eft), |R|(ight), |T|(op) and |B|(ottom) mean
% edges moved by a given extension.  Therefore, for example,
% ``|L/R outside & T/B up|'' for |f|(loat) region means it is enlarged
% horizontally and shifted up vertically by the asymmetric extension
% |(4pt,4pt)(4pt,-4pt)|.  These a little bit complicated setting of
% extensions are to solve the problems in the fundamental example shown in
% previous four pages, namely too strict definition of the regions to be
% painted.  That is, both vertical edges of regions having texts, e.g.,
% |c|(olumn) regions, should look too close to the first and last letters.
% Similarly both horizontal edges of those regions seem too close especially
% when the first line is tall (e.g., the section title in
% p.\Tie\pageref{sec:bgpaint} and the page-wise figure in
% p.\Tie\pageref{page:bgpaint2}) and the last line of a column is followed by
% \mctext{} or \postenv.  Therefore, the author made fine tuning moving
% inside edges of margins outside, and so on.  We will come back this issue

% \endgroup
% \end{paracol}
% \bigskip
% 
% In the setting with \!\backgroundcolor! commands in
% p.\Tie\pageref{sec:bgpaint-me}, the author carefully moved contacting edges
% of regions.  For example, to enlarge |c|(olumn) regions, the inside edges
% of |l|(eft margin) and |r|(ight margin) regions are moved outside, and both
% vertical edges of the |g|(ap) region shifted toward its inside.  As for
% the horizontal edges, the bottom edges of |t|(op margin) and |f|(loat)
% regions are moved up, the top edges of |b|(ottom margin) and
% (foot)|n|(ote) regions are moved down, and both top and bottom edges of
% the |s|(panning text) region are shifted toward its inside.
% 
% These edge shifting could make a region too narrow or too much shifted
% resulting in a material in it overreaching its boundary, especially in
% vertical shifting of horizontal edges.  However we can exploit some large
% space automatically or manually inserted above and/or below the material
% to avoid overreaching.  That is the author exploited the following spaces;
% \!\headsep! below the page head (though it is empty in this document);
% \!\dbltextfloatsep! below the bottom-most page-wise float; spaces that
% \!\subsection!|*| inserts above and below it together with manually
% inserted \!\medskip! below it; \!\skip!\!\footins!\footnote{
% 
% This is a kind of ``length command'' maybe not widely known.}
% 
% above the first footnote which the author enlarged by 4\,|pt| temporarily
% for this and the next subsections; and \!\footskip! from the bottom edge
% of text area to that of the page number.
% 
% Now you might notice that the explanation above does not mention the |p|
% region for \Preenv{} and \postenv.  As you should find in the settings,
% this region is enlarged horizontally \emph{and vertically} so that its top
% and bottom edges are moved up and down when the region is at the top or
% bottom of a page, as you are seeing now and find in
% p.\Tie\pageref{sec:bgpaint-me}.  However, this enlargement of course has a
% side effect that the region collides against |c|(olumn) and |g|(ap) regions
% also enlarged vertically making them overlapped.  This overlap will be
% invisible with most of \emph{printers} because, as shown in
% Section\Tie\ref{sec:ref-bgpaint}, |p| region is painted \emph{before} |c|
% and |g| regions are painted.  In addition, since relatively large spaces
% of \!\bigskip! are manually inserted before each \beginparacol{} and after
% each \Endparacol{}, texts in \Preenv{} and \postenv{} are well separated
% from region boundaries.
% 
% This overlay painting |c| and |g| over |p|, however, might produce an
% unexpected result with some printer with which, for example, two colors
% are \emph{blended} in the thin overlapped strip\footnote{
% 
% For example, a dvi previewer |dviout| produces such a blended result with
% the default setting of coloring.}.
% 
% Unfortunately, this overlay painting is inevitable in the current version
% 1.3, but in a future version, hopefully 1.4, more sophisticated
% \emph{position-dependent} region definition, for example, to shift the top
% edge of |p| region only when the region is at the top of page, could be
% introduced.
% 
% Another remark is that the \mirror{}ing specified by the |b| feature of
% \!\twosided! works not only on the colors of side margins but also on
% their asymmetric shrinkage.  That is, the asymmetric shifts of vertical
% edges of |l| and |r| regions correctly performed irrespective of their
% physical positions, i.e., even when the |l| (resp.\ |r|) region is at
% the right (resp.\ left) margin and the edge to be shift is the left
% (resp.\ right) one rather than right (resp.\ left).

% \env{paracol} environment (maybe) of course.  Therefore, the next page is
% \emph{not} painted because the page does not have any parallel-columned
% stuff.  Therefore, even if you wish to paint the whole of your document
% including pages without \env{paracol} stuff, you cannot do it just with
% \Paracol{} package, at least so far.
% 
% On the other hand, some materials given outside \env{paracol} environments
% are painted as if they are given in the environment when they are
% \emph{imported} into the environment.  One category has footnotes given in
% \preenv{} when \!\footnotelayout!|{m}| is specified for merging, as
% exemplified by the footnote \ref{fn:bgpaint-inf1} in the previous page.
% Note that such a footnote is painted by the color for |n| region rather
% than |p| region even when there are no footnotes in the \env{paracol}
% environment.  The other category has ordinary floats given by \env{figure}
% and/or \env{table}
% (i.e., neither \env{figure*} nor \env{table*}) environments outside
% \env{paracol} and then \emph{deferred} to a page having (a portion of)
% stuff produced by \env{paracol}.  Since such a float, e.g.,
% Figure\Tie\ref{fig:bgpaint-inf} in this page, is considered as a page-wise
% float given in the \env{paracol} environment in this section, its
% background is painted by the color for the |f| region, rather than that
% for the |p| region which would be used if the float were is placed in the
% previous page.  Note that such a deferred float import could occur not
% only from the page having \beginparacol{} but also from pages preceding
% it.  For example, if you have three \env{figure} environments in a page
% $p-1$ just preceding the page $p$ in which you start a \env{paracol}
% environment, it could happen that first one is placed in $p-1$ without
% painting, the second is placed in $p$ and painted by the color for |p|,
% and the third is placed in $p+1$ and painted by the color for |f|.
% 
% Finally some materials \emph{exported} from a \env{paracol} environment
% are painted as if they are in \postenv.  In previous two subsections, we
% saw \Mgfnote{}s (e.g., \ref{fn:bgpaint1} in p.\Tie\pageref{fn:bgpaint1}
% and \ref{fn:bgpaint-me1} in p.\Tie\pageref{fn:bgpaint-me1}) are painted by
% the color of |p| rather than |n|.  The other kind of exportation is of
% page-wise floats given in a \env{paracol} environment but deferred to the
% page next to the page having \Endparacol, or further.  For example,
% Figure~\ref{fig:bgpaint-inf2} is given in the \env{paracol} environment
% above in this page, but its \bground{} is not painted because the next page
% in which the figure is placed does not have any parallel-columned
% stuff\footnote{
% 
% If it has, the background is painted by the color for |p|.}.
