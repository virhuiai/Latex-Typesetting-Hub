% You are now seeing another \bgpaint{} much different from previous two
% examples.  That is, after disabling painting of |t|, |b|, |l|, |r| and |g|
% regions by \Uidx{\!\nobackgroundcolor!}, the author gave the followings
% for painting this and the next pages.

% The first two lines above is different from the previous declaration
% because inside edges of |c[0]| and |c[1]| regions are shifted toward
% outside of them and thus inside of unpainted |g| region so that the edges
% are contacted.  On the other hand, the last two lines are for
% \emph{under-painting} of columns and has \emph{\bginfext} to make top,
% bottom and outside edges of |C| regions reaching to the corresponding
% paper edges.  Since this under-painting is done with colors same as those
% of over-painting of |c| regions, you will have an impression that the
% paper is two-toned and \pwstuff{} are pasted on the paper\footnote{

% 
% Note that overlay painting is inevitable for two-toned page painting, as
% far as you want to paint \bground{} of \pwstuff.
% 
% The last issue of \bgpaint{} is about painting materials given outside
% \env{paracol}.  As you have seen, \Preenv{} and \postenv{} are painted but
% it is done only when they reside in a page having a portion of a
% \env{paracol} environment (maybe) of course.  Therefore, the next page is
% \emph{not} painted because the page does not have any parallel-columned
% stuff.  Therefore, even if you wish to paint the whole of your document
% including pages without \env{paracol} stuff, you cannot do it just with
% \Paracol{} package, at least so far.
% 
% On the other hand, some materials given outside \env{paracol} environments
% are painted as if they are given in the environment when they are
% \emph{imported} into the environment.  One category has footnotes given in
% \preenv{} when \!\footnotelayout!|{m}| is specified for merging, as
% exemplified by the footnote \ref{fn:bgpaint-inf1} in the previous page.
% Note that such a footnote is painted by the color for |n| region rather
% than |p| region even when there are no footnotes in the \env{paracol}
% environment.  The other category has ordinary floats given by \env{figure}
% and/or \env{table}
% (i.e., neither \env{figure*} nor \env{table*}) environments outside
% \env{paracol} and then \emph{deferred} to a page having (a portion of)
% stuff produced by \env{paracol}.  Since such a float, e.g.,
% Figure\Tie\ref{fig:bgpaint-inf} in this page, is considered as a page-wise
% float given in the \env{paracol} environment in this section, its
% background is painted by the color for the |f| region, rather than that
% for the |p| region which would be used if the float were is placed in the
% previous page.  Note that such a deferred float import could occur not
% only from the page having \beginparacol{} but also from pages preceding
% it.  For example, if you have three \env{figure} environments in a page
% $p-1$ just preceding the page $p$ in which you start a \env{paracol}
% environment, it could happen that first one is placed in $p-1$ without
% painting, the second is placed in $p$ and painted by the color for |p|,
% and the third is placed in $p+1$ and painted by the color for |f|.
% 
% Finally some materials \emph{exported} from a \env{paracol} environment
% are painted as if they are in \postenv.  In previous two subsections, we
% saw \Mgfnote{}s (e.g., \ref{fn:bgpaint1} in p.\Tie\pageref{fn:bgpaint1}
% and \ref{fn:bgpaint-me1} in p.\Tie\pageref{fn:bgpaint-me1}) are painted by
% the color of |p| rather than |n|.  The other kind of exportation is of
% page-wise floats given in a \env{paracol} environment but deferred to the
% page next to the page having \Endparacol, or further.  For example,
% Figure~\ref{fig:bgpaint-inf2} is given in the \env{paracol} environment
% above in this page, but its \bground{} is not painted because the next page
% in which the figure is placed does not have any parallel-columned
% stuff\footnote{
% 
% If it has, the background is painted by the color for |p|.}.
